# nhl-score-api

A JSON API that returns the scores and goals from the latest finished or on-going NHL games. The data is sourced from the
same NHL Stats API at https://api-web.nhle.com that the NHL website uses. The NHL Stats API is undocumented but
unofficial documentation exists:

- https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference: fairly recent, seems very comprehensive and updated lately
- https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi: older, plenty of discussion in its [issues](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/issues)
  (thoughly mainly on the previous NHL Stats API version)

How we use the NHL Stats API:

- [schedule](https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/schedule/2023-11-07) gives us a list of the week's games; we check the game
  statuses and get the game IDs to fetch the games' gamecenter landing page and right-rail data
- [landing](https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/2023020180/landing) gives us basic details of an individual game
- [right-rail](https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/2023020180/right-rail) gives us more details of an individual game,
  like game stats and recap video links
- [standings](https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/standings/2023-11-07) gives us team stats

This API is available at https://nhl-score-api.herokuapp.com/, and it serves as the backend for [nhl-recap](https://github.com/peruukki/nhl-recap).

The NHL Stats API responses are cached in-memory for one minute, and then refreshed upon the next request. So there can be
quite a bit of variance in response times.

## API

### Scores from latest finished NHL games

#### `GET` [/api/scores/latest](https://nhl-score-api.herokuapp.com/api/scores/latest)

Returns an object with the date and the scores from the latest round’s games.

The `date` object contains the date in a raw format and a prettier, displayable format, or
`null` if there are no scores.

The `games` array contains details of the games, each game item containing these fields:

- `status` _(object)_
- `startTime` _(string)_
- `goals` _(array)_
- `scores` _(object)_
- `teams` _(object)_
- `gameStats` _(object)_
- `preGameStats` _(object)_
- `currentStats` _(object)_
- `links` _(object)_
- `errors` _(array)_ (only present if data validity errors were detected)

The fields are described in more detail in [Response fields](#response-fields).

### Scores / game previews from given date range

#### `GET` [/api/scores?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD](https://nhl-score-api.herokuapp.com/api/scores?startDate=2023-11-12&endDate=2023-11-13)

Returns an array of objects with the date and the scores from given date range’s games.
Both `startDate` and `endDate` are inclusive, and `endDate` is optional. **The range is
limited to a maximum of 7 days** to set some reasonable limit for the (cached) response;
this also matches the NHL Stats API that returns one week's schedule at a time.

The `date` object contains the date in a raw format and a prettier, displayable format. Contrary to the
`/api/scores/latest` endpoint, the `date` is included even if that date has no scheduled games.
Though see the "If a date has no scheduled games" part below for possible peculiarities in that case.

The `games` array contains details of the games, each game item containing these fields:

- `status` _(object)_
- `startTime` _(string)_
- `goals` _(array)_
- `scores` _(object)_
- `teams` _(object)_
- `gameStats` _(object)_
- `preGameStats` _(object)_
- `currentStats` _(object)_
- `links` _(object)_
- `errors` _(array)_ (only present if data validity errors were detected)

**If a date has no scheduled games**, you will either get:

- no entry for that date in the response, or
- an entry with an empty `games` array

This variety comes directly from the NHL Stats API response, I don’t know why it
behaves differently for some date ranges than others. Check the entries’ `date` > `raw`
field to see what dates are actually included.

The fields are described in more detail in [Response fields](#response-fields).

- `errors` array: list of data validation errors, only present if any were detected. Sometimes the NHL Stats API temporarily contains
  invalid or missing data. Currently we check if the goal data from the NHL Stats API (read from its `scoringPlays` field) contains the
  same number of goals than the score data (read from its `teams` field). If it doesn't, two different errors can be reported:
  - `{ "error": "MISSING-ALL-GOALS" }`: all goal data is missing; this has happened occasionally
  - `{ "error": "SCORE-AND-GOAL-COUNT-MISMATCH", "details": { "goalCount": 3, "scoreCount": 4 } }`: goal data exists but doesn't contain
    the same number of goals than the teams' scores; haven't noticed this happen but good to check anyway

**Note on overtimes:** Only regular season 5 minute overtimes are considered "overtime" in the
`goals` array. Playoff overtime periods are returned as period 4, 5, and so on, since they are
20 minute periods. However, all games (including playoff games) that went into overtime are
marked as having ended in overtime in the `scores` object.

## Requirements

- Java version 8
- [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) is used for all project management.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) can be used optionally for running the application locally.

## Running application

### Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

To run the application locally in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, install Docker and run:

```sh
./docker-up.sh
```

Downloading the [Clojure](https://hub.docker.com/_/clojure/) image will take quite a while on the first run,
but it will be reused after that.

To delete all containers, run:

```sh
./docker-down.sh
```

### Without Docker

You can also run the application locally with `lein run`.

## Running tests

Run tests with the [Kaocha test runner](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha) for improved test failure reporting:

```sh
lein kaocha [--watch]
```

Run single tests or test groups with [Kaocha's `--focus` argument](https://cljdoc.org/d/lambdaisland/kaocha/0.0-590/doc/focusing-on-specific-tests), e.g.:

```sh
lein kaocha --focus nhl-score-api.fetchers.nhlstats.game-scores-test/game-scores-parsing-scores
```

Or with the regular test runner:

```sh
lein test
```

## Linting

Lint the code with the [clj-kondo Leiningen plugin](https://github.com/clj-kondo/lein-clj-kondo):

```sh
lein lint
```

## Updating test data

The NHL API responses change from time to time, so the [responses](test/nhl_score_api/fetchers/nhl_api_web/resources/)
used in tests also need to be updated to remain accurate.

Especially the game-specific API responses need frequent updating, so there is a helper script to fetch the current
responses with game IDs and save them. It's also useful for checking if the NHL API responses have changed in case of
errors. Though note that not all data should be updated; at least game progress data changes should be discarded so that
the tests that rely on that still work.

The script is called `update-game-test-data.sh` and it uses `curl` for fetching and [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
for formatting, so you'll need those installed.

Example:

```sh
$ ./scripts/update-game-test-data.sh 2023020205 2023020206
Fetching landing for game ID 2023020205
Landing response saved to test/nhl_score_api/fetchers/nhl_api_web/resources/landing-2023020205.json
Fetching right-rail for game ID 2023020205
Right-rail response saved to test/nhl_score_api/fetchers/nhl_api_web/resources/right-rail-2023020205.json
Fetching landing for game ID 2023020206
Landing response saved to test/nhl_score_api/fetchers/nhl_api_web/resources/landing-2023020206.json
Fetching right-rail for game ID 2023020206
Right-rail response saved to test/nhl_score_api/fetchers/nhl_api_web/resources/right-rail-2023020206.json
```

## Deployment

The API is deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) by running the [Deployment workflow](https://github.com/peruukki/nhl-score-api/actions/workflows/deployment.yml).
The workflow requires these set in _Actions secrets and variables_ in the repository's settings:

- `HEROKU_API_KEY` repository secret: you can find this from the _API Key_ section in your Heroku account settings
- `HEROKU_APP_NAME` repository variable: your app name in Heroku

### Alternative deployment from development machine

Usual deployment process:

```sh
# Bump version
lein release <:minor|:patch>
# Build
lein uberjar
# Deploy to Heroku
./deploy.sh
# Push to Git
git push origin master --tags
```

### Heroku deployment setup

1. Create a Java web app in Heroku
2. Add and set up the [New Relic APM](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/newrelic) Heroku add-on
   - The add-on will automatically add the necessary Heroku environment variables
   - Ensure the Java agent is set too: `heroku config:set JAVA_OPTS='-javaagent:newrelic/newrelic.jar'`
   - No need to copy New Relic JAR files locally, they are downloaded in [`deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh)
3. Install and set up the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
4. Install the [Heroku Java CLI plugin](https://github.com/heroku/plugin-java):

```sh
heroku plugins:install java
# alternative if the above doesn't work:
heroku plugins:install @heroku-cli/plugin-java
```

5. If you have multiple Heroku apps, set the default app for this repository:

```sh
heroku git:remote -a <heroku-app-name>
```
